A Simple Application for Artists: Keep track of your favorite supplies with reviews and swatches you can access from anywhere

# Background
When it comes to art supplies, I'm something of a hoarder. I love to know that I can complete whatever project I think of because I have such a wide range of media in my studio. But this leads to a little problem: I can't remember what half the supplies look like in use. That acrylic paint may dry to a completely different color, and that marker cap may be misleadingly saturated compared to the actual marker pigment. One solution is to keep piles of swatch sheets in a folder, but I need so many I'd have to start a dedicated cabinet. 

A better solution? Create a space online where artists can add swatches of the supplies they use along with reviews of how they liked using them. Now you can keep a swatches for an art supply used on different materials, in different lighting, or using different application techniques and have easy access to them from wherever you're creating. If you feel like showing off you can even add photos of what you've created with those materials so people can really see their full potential. Upload as many art supplies and swatches as you like for personal reference on your own palette page, or look at other artists' supply reviews and swatches in the art supply index to see what media you might like to try next! We'll keep track of everything so you can focus on creating.
